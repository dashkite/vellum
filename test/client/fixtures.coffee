        The Republic (Greek: Πολιτεία, translit. Politeia; Latin: De Republica)
        is a Socratic dialogue, authored by Plato around 375 BC, concerning
        justice (δικαιοσύνη), the order and character of the just city-state,
        and the just man. It is Plato's best-known work, and has proven to be
        one of the world's most influential works of philosophy and political
        theory, both intellectually and historically.
